# gh-129-durable-run-state-phase-b — Summary

Lane: high-risk
Confidence: high
Reason: 3 risk flags fire — public contracts (`scripts/deploy-harness.sh`'s `SYNCED_DIRS_RE` governs what every consuming repo receives; extending it to `runtime/` changes that distribution contract), existing behavior (modifying tested `deploy-harness.sh`/`install-harness.sh`), weak proof (the issue itself calls for new install/resync regression coverage for this path, implying current coverage doesn't reach it). No literal detectable hard gate from `harness-manifest.json` fires (not auth/authorization/data-loss-migration/audit/external-provider/public-contract-keyword/high-blast-path/workflow-engine), but orphan pruning is a destructive file operation and this repo has two prior recorded incidents in this exact area (`docs/solutions/harness/deploy-harness-does-not-prune-deleted-orphans.md`, `docs/solutions/harness/resync-protected-files-decisions.md`) — classifying high-risk by judgment given the distribution blast radius, not a mechanical hard-gate hit.
Flags: public-contracts, existing-behavior, weak-proof
Affects: scripts/deploy-harness.sh, scripts/install-harness.sh, harness-manifest.json (the deploy/resync distribution contract)
Input-type: spec slice

> `Lane` drives **ceremony** (how much proof). `Confidence` drives **interruption**

### Intent

<paste the original request, verbatim>
"newbranch for phase b, and start /feature-intake"

Context established earlier in the same conversation: the user is working through GitHub issue
#129 ("Durable Run State Contract") phase by phase. Phase A (the engine + CLI) is complete,
reviewed, and merged via PR #164 into the epic/integration branch `feat/gh-129-durable-run-state`
(itself branched from `loop`, not `main` — the plan is to land Phase A/B/C/D there and test them
together before one final merge decision into `loop`). This request starts Phase B.

Phase B scope (from issue #129, "Phase B — Portable deployment"):
- Sync `runtime/` into `.claude/runtime/`.
- Extend installer/resync manifests and orphan pruning.
- Add install and resync regression coverage.
- Register runtime contract paths in the harness manifest.

Explicitly out of scope for this phase (deferred per the issue): Phase C (wiring into
feature-intake / finishing-a-development-branch / SessionStart / harness-status), Phase D
(design.md/PLAN.md documentation rollout, cross-OS CI validation of the full contract).

## What changed

Relocated the Phase A engine from `scripts/run_state.py`/`scripts/test_run_state.py` to
`runtime/run_state.py`/`runtime/test_run_state.py` (pure `git mv`, zero content change), and
registered `runtime/` into the existing generic deploy/install/test surfaces:
`scripts/deploy-harness.sh` (`SYNCED_DIRS_RE` + the sync loop — no new pruning logic needed, the
existing mechanism is already dir-agnostic), `scripts/install-harness.sh` (`PAYLOAD` array), and
`scripts/run-tests.sh` (`PYTESTS` list — this also closed a real wiring gap: Phase A's 29 tests
were never actually included in the repo's aggregate test run, only when targeted directly).
Added `tests/scripts/runtime-sync.test.sh` (6 cases, mirroring `deploy-prune.test.sh`) proving
`runtime/` sync + orphan-prune + consumer-addition-survival behavior. `harness-manifest.json`
`contracts` registration is explicitly deferred to Phase C (see Rationale).

### Rationale

`scripts/check_manifest.py`'s Check C rejects a `contracts` entry with an empty `consumers`
list — since nothing in this repo calls `runtime/run_state.py` until Phase C wires an actual
caller, there was no defensible way to register the manifest entry now without either weakening
that check (out of scope for this phase) or listing a stretch/placeholder consumer. Confirmed
with the user during `/brainstorming`: defer to Phase C. Everything else in the issue's Phase B
scope reuses the harness's existing, already-tested sync/prune mechanism rather than building
anything new — research (`research-brief.md`) confirmed the "orphan pruning" gap the issue
references was already fixed before this phase started.

### Alternatives considered

- Building a `runtime/`-specific parallel sync mechanism instead of registering into the
  existing one — rejected: would duplicate `copy_dir`/`prune_orphans` for no benefit and break
  the "one generic mechanism, N registered dirs" pattern already used for 5 other dirs.
- Registering the `harness-manifest.json` contract now with a placeholder/stretch consumer —
  rejected in favor of deferring to Phase C (see Rationale); a stretch consumer would satisfy
  the mechanical check without being true.

### Deviations

- Rule 2 — Fixed a stale "5 synced dirs" comment (now 6) directly adjacent to the Task 1.2 edit
  it was made stale by; flagged by code-quality review. `scripts/deploy-harness.sh`. Commit
  `a13ddf8`.
- Rule 1 — Fixed 2 adversarial correctness-review findings (both mechanical, no architectural
  judgment): `install-harness.sh`'s legacy-detection loop now skips `runtime` (it was added to
  `PAYLOAD` this phase, so no prior installer version could ever have staged it at a consumer's
  root — any hit was guaranteed to be the consumer's own directory, a false-positive warning
  that risked misleading a user into deleting their own code); `runtime-sync.test.sh`'s
  `new_target()` no longer loses its `_CLEANUP_DIRS` registration to a command-substitution
  subshell (all 6 temp dirs were leaking on every run — confirmed via a temporary debug count,
  0 before the fix, 6 after). `scripts/install-harness.sh`, `tests/scripts/runtime-sync.test.sh`.
  Commit `bfbf619`.

### Advisory Findings

<!-- From /correctness-review: findings that scored 0 (unmodified-line rule) — not fixed,
     not discarded — reported for a human to weigh. -->

- **(unmodified-line) `scripts/lint-doc-truth.sh`'s `KNOWN_ROOTS` doesn't include `runtime`.**
  `runtime/` is now a first-class synced repo root (same status as `skills`/`hooks`/`rules`/
  `templates`/`agents`), but the doc-truth lint's root allowlist wasn't updated to match — a
  backticked `` `runtime/…` `` path reference in a core doc (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`,
  `rules/*.md`, etc.) with a typo would silently pass the lint instead of failing it, unlike
  every other synced dir. No current trigger (no core doc references `runtime/` yet). Not fixed
  in this phase (line wasn't touched by this diff); worth a one-line follow-up
  (`scripts/lint-doc-truth.sh:34`, add `runtime` to `KNOWN_ROOTS`) before any doc references
  `runtime/` paths.
- **(unmodified-line, inherited from Phase A) `runtime/test_run_state.py:502`'s sibling-path
  resolution via `os.path.abspath(__file__).replace(...)` is theoretically fragile if `__file__`
  is ever relative when the concurrency test runs** (possible only under uncommon pytest
  invocation modes; not observed in practice — normal `python -m pytest` invocation always
  yields an absolute `__file__`). Byte-identical logic to the Phase A version; the `scripts/` →
  `runtime/` move did not introduce or worsen it. Not fixed — flagged for visibility only.
- **(unmodified-line) `scripts/deploy-harness.sh`'s summary output block (`SK`/`AG`/`HK`/`RL`
  counters) still doesn't include a `runtime` line** — same as the pre-existing `templates` gap
  (see PLAN.md §2 Non-goals: deliberately not added, to avoid an unexplained asymmetry). Not a
  defect, restated here only because correctness-review independently surfaced it as a
  non-finding worth noting.

### Verify

| Check | Command | Exit | Notes | Criterion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unit | `python3 -m pytest runtime/test_run_state.py -q` | 0 | 29 tests pass at the new location | SC-1 |
| unit | `bash -c "! test -e scripts/run_state.py && ! test -e scripts/test_run_state.py"` | 0 | old paths genuinely gone | SC-2 |
| integration | `bash -c 'T=$(mktemp -d); bash scripts/deploy-harness.sh --target "$T" >/dev/null 2>&1; [ -f "$T/.claude/runtime/run_state.py" ]; rc=$?; rm -rf "$T"; exit $rc'` | 0 | fresh deploy places runtime/ under .claude/ | SC-3 |
| unit | `grep -q "templates runtime settings.json" scripts/install-harness.sh` | 0 | PAYLOAD includes runtime | SC-4 |
| unit | `grep -q "runtime/test_run_state.py" scripts/run-tests.sh` | 0 | wiring gap closed | SC-5 |
| integration | `bash tests/scripts/runtime-sync.test.sh` | 0 | 6/6 cases pass; mutation-tested by code-quality review (4/6 cases correctly fail when runtime/ registration is removed) | SC-6 |
`bash scripts/run-tests.sh` was also run from the repo root and confirmed ALL GREEN (214 python
tests + all shell suites, both before and after the correctness-review fixes) as a repo-wide
regression check — not listed as its own Verify row per
`docs/solutions/harness/verify-row-must-be-pipe-free-and-under-60s.md` (whole-suite command
risks the 60s per-row re-run cap, and did in fact time out under `verify_summary.py --check`
when tried as a row here).

### Intent Findings

<!-- From /intent-review: findings against the verbatim original request, blind to PLAN.md. -->

- **(drift, behaviorally different — report-only, already user-confirmed)** Issue #129's Phase B
  bullet list includes "Register runtime contract paths in the harness manifest," but this diff
  does not touch `harness-manifest.json` — deferred to Phase C (see Rationale above:
  `check_manifest.py` Check C rejects an empty `consumers` list, no real consumer exists yet).
  This deferral was explicitly confirmed with the user during `/brainstorming` before
  implementation started, so intent-review correctly classified it as drift rather than an
  unapproved gap, and routed it advisory/record rather than fix-loop or escalate. One practical
  follow-up the reviewer flagged: issue #129's Phase B checklist item will read as unchecked
  until Phase C adds the manifest entry — worth a comment on the issue noting the deferral so it
  doesn't read as forgotten.

### Rollback

- `git revert 8981203..HEAD` (or revert the individual task commits: `8981203` move,
  `caf67be` deploy-harness.sh, `bfc7979` install-harness.sh, `d9ae778` run-tests.sh, `a13ddf8`
  comment fix, `3c162e0` new test file) — all reversible; no data migration, no destructive
  operation, no external state change.

### Harness-Delta

- none
